// We can't modify this file since it's read-only, but in a real application,
// we would add the NavExtension component to the main App layout
// For our purposes, we'll import it directly in the Customizer and Profile pages

// Since we cannot modify main.tsx or App.tsx, let's update the Customizer.tsx 
// to include our NavExtension component at the top level
